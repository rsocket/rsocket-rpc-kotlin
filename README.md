# RSocket RPC - Kotlin
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rsocket/rsocket-rpc-kotlin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rsocket/rsocket-rpc-kotlin)

The standard [RSocket](http://rsocket.io) RPC implementation based on [RSocket-kotlin](https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-kotlin) and [RxJava2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava).  
RSocket is binary application protocol with pluggable transports which models all communication as [Reactive Streams](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/master/README.md) of messages multiplexed over a single network connection, and never synchronously blocks while waiting for a response.
## Build and binaries

Snapshots are available on Bintray

```groovy
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://oss.jfrog.org/libs-snapshot' }
    }
```

```groovy
    dependencies {
        compile 'io.rsocket.rpc.kotlin:rsocket-rpc-core:<TBD>'
    }
```

## Getting started  
TBD

## Development  

1. Building RSocket-RPC-kotlin requires installation of the [Protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf) compiler. RSocket RPC requires Protobuf 3.6.x or higher.

    For Mac users you can easily install the Protobuf compiler using Homebrew:

        $ brew install protobuf

    For other operating systems you can install the Protobuf compiler using the pre-built packages hosted on the [Protobuf Releases](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases) page.

2. Run the following Gradle command to build the project:

        $ ./gradlew clean build
